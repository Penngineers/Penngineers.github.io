A warm welcome to all the people visiting our page. We are the team Penngineers. We are first year graduate students in the Electrical Engineering program at University of Pennsylvania specializing in Circuits and Computer Engineering. We designed the following game as a final project for our course ESE 5190: Embedded Systems. We had a lot of fun while building this project. We will be walking you through a detailed description of our project which will help you understand it in depth in case you wish to recreate it.

We designed an arcade game called Whack-It-First inspired by the famous game Whack-A-Mole. However, instead of replicating the good old Whack-A-Mole game completely we decided to change it up in order to make it even more exciting to play. Our game, Whack-It-First is a two player game where two people need to team up to play this game together. The gaming interface consists of 4 arcade buttons in colors: Blue, Red, White and Yellow on each side which represent the moles, two green colored arcade buttons which indicate the commencement of the game, a speaker module which plays music at the same time as the green colored arcade buttons glow to indicate the commencement of the game, a pink colored arcade button which is required to be pressed to commence the game, a TFT display which guides the players by displaying instructions and a LED matrix which displays the score. Our gaming interface is as seen in the image below. Once the game commences, two same colored arcade buttons will glow on each side and the two players need to hit the glowing buttons in unison to record a score. In case, if the players do not hit the glowing arcade buttons at the same time or if one of the players hits the wrong arcade button or if the players exceed the wait time provided to hit the glowing arcade buttons, the game ends. As the game proceeds and the players cross a certain score which we have set as a threshold value, the game becomes faster and even more thrilling to play. We have inserted a video capturing the game in action below.
